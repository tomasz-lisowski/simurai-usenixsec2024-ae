[general]
; General settings for the operation of Yate

; modload: boolean: Should a module be loaded by default if there is no
;  reference to it in the [modules] section
;modload=enable

; modpath: string: Overrides the runtime module directory path which is
;  compiled in or specified with the -m command line option. Note that this
;  setting takes priority over anything else
; Note that you MUST NOT add a path separator at the end
;modpath=

; extrapath: string: Absolute or relative path to an extra modules directory,
;  gets loaded before those added by command line -x parameters
; Note that you MUST NOT add a path separator at the end

; This parameter is reloadable
; Valid range 1 to 10, default 1

;maxmsgage=0

; maxevents: int: Maximum number of events kept per type
; This parameter is reloadable
; Valid range 0 to 1000, default 25, 0 disables limit
;maxevents=25

; startevents: boolean: Capture all debug events at startup
;startevents=yes

; restarts: int: Time in seconds after startup the engine will try to restart
;  to clean up any accumulating problems. Restarts are performed only when
;  started in supervised mode
; If at restart time at least one of the modules is busy it will try again to
;  restart every 10 seconds
;restarts=0

; timejump: int: Forward system time jump in seconds accepted without restart
; If non-zero and system time jumps backwards or too much forward
;  an alert will be logged and if supervised the engine will restart
; Valid range 8 to 120, 0 disables check (default)
;timejump=0

; warntime: int: Warn time limit for message dispatch in milliseconds, a value
;  of zero disables such warnings
;warntime=0

; idlemsec: int: System idle time in milliseconds
;  Set to zero to use platform default
;  If not set the platform default is doubled only in client mode
;idlemsec=

; wintimer: int: Requested timer resolution in milliseconds (Windows only, does
;  not work on 9x and ME). The default resolution depends on hardware, Windows
;  version and currently running programs
;wintimer=0

; trackparam: string: Name of the parameter used to track message through handlers
;  If empty or boolean true the default "handlers" will be used instead
;  Set to boolean false to disable tracking only if you are sure what you want
;trackparam=handlers

; abortinfo: boolean: Display some engine statistics during a process abort
;abortinfo=enable

; nodeid: int: ID assigned to this node
;nodeid=

; nodebits: int: Length in bits of the node ID
;  Range 0 - 10. 0 means that node ID will be ignored
;nodebits=0

; msgsniff: bool: Activate message sniffer module (if loaded) at engine init time
;msgsniff=disable

; filtersniff: regexp: Default filter to apply to message sniffer at initialization
; If empty it will match all messages except engine.timer which is never displayed
; Example for a filter matching all chan.Anything messages and engine.halt:
;  filtersniff=^\(chan\.\|engine\.halt$\)
;filtersniff=


[modules]
; This section should hold one line for each module whose loading behaviour
;  is to be changed from the default specified by modload= in section [general]
; Each line has to be of the form:
;   modulename.yate=boolean
; Note that modules can be located only in the module directory so no path
;  information should be specified


[localsym]
; This section is used to force some modules to be loaded without their
;  symbols being globally available - if the operating system supports.
; Windows will ignore this section completely.
; Each line has to be of the form:
;   modulename.yate=boolean

; pwlib does not clean up properly on Linux so we must disable global symbols
;  unfortunately preventing all pwlib plugins from loading
h323chan.yate=yes


[nounload]
; This section is used to prevent some modules from being unloaded from
;  memory, although finalization will be attempted if possible.
; Each line has to be of the form:
;   modulename.yate=boolean


[preload]
; Put a line in this section for each shared library that you want to load
;  before any Yate module
; Each line has to be of the form:
;   /path/to/the/library.so=boolean
; You should specify the full path to the library. Extension is operating
;  system specific - usually .so for *NIX systems and .dll for Windows


[postload]
; Put a line in this section for each shared library that you want to load
;  after all Yate modules
; Each line has to be of the form:
;   /path/to/the/library.so=boolean
; You should specify the full path to the library. Extension is operating
;  system specific - usually .so for *NIX systems and .dll for Windows


[debug]
; Each line in this section generates an engine.debug message immediately
;  after the first initialization. This is equivalent of issuing the debug
;  command in the Remote Manager.
; Each line has to be of the form:
;  modulename=parameters to debug
; Examples:
;  tone=off
;  h323=level 9
;  sip=level 8
;  sip=filter 127.0.0.1


[run_params]
; Extra runtime parameters to add to the Engine at startup
; It is not possible to overwrite existing parameters, only add new ones
; These parameters are only loaded once at startup
; Use the 'runparam' command to add more later
; Examples:
;  temppath=/tmp
;  remote_ip=10.1.2.3


[variables]
; Each line in this section initializes a variable in the Engine's shared list
; These variables can be accessed and modified from each module
; Examples:
;  index1=5
;  custom=EXAMPLE


[telephony]
; Default settings for telephony drivers

; timeout: int: Default channel timeout in milliseconds
;timeout=0

; maxroute: int: Maximum number of calls routed at once by each driver
;maxroute=0

; maxchans: int: Maximum number of channels running at once in each driver
;maxchans=0

; dtmfdups: bool: Allow duplicate DTMFs (detected with different methods)
;dtmfdups=disable
